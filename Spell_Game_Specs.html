			<h3>What is The Spelling Game?</h3>
		</div>
		
			<p>
			I developed The Spelling Game between February 20th and February 23rd, 2020, to fulfill a homework requirement for CSCI 4208 at the University of New Orleans.    
			<br><br>
			The game is very simple to use.  The user clicks a button which provides a recording of a hard-to-spell word.  Then, the game provides a text box in which the user can spell the word.  The game checks to determine if the word has been spelled correctly.  If so, the game responds with <i>Correct!</i>  Otherwise the game responds with <i>Not Correct!</i>
			<br><br>
			This is a very casual game.  There are no time limits, and the user can attempt as many spellings as he or she desires.

			<h3>Spelling Game Roles</h3>
		</div>
		
		
			<p>
			<u>System Administrator</u> – The System Administrator has no role.  The typical duties of an Administrator (OS updates, security, establishment of accounts, software installation) do not apply to the conversion of The Spelling Game to Electron format.
			<br><br>
			<u>Regular Users and Guests</u> – The Spelling Game will not differentiate between regular users and guests.  The user flow for regular users and guests will be as described in the slide, <a href="#userStory2">User Story – Detailed Version.</a>

			<h3>User Story – Post-it Version</h3>
		</div>
		
			<p>
			As a user of The Spelling Game, I want a standalone desktop application that is easy to use and provides no time constraints, so that I can enjoy myself during leisure time.

			<h3>User Story – Detailed Version</h3>
		</div>
		
			<p>
			The Electron version of The Spelling Game will be distributed in a zip file.  After the file is unzipped, the user will find an exe file.  Clicking on the exe file will open The Spelling Game on the desktop.  After reading the instructions, the user will click a button to hear the hard-to-spell word.  One button is provided for each of the 26 letters of the alphabet.
			<br><br>
			A text box is provided for the user to attempt to spell the word.  After the user spells the word, the game will inform the user whether he or she spelled it correctly or not.  The user may attempt to re-spell as many times as he or she likes.
			<br><br>
			Alternatively, the user may continue down the list to attempt to spell other words.  There is no timer or ticking clock which specifies the amount of time the user can spend on any one word.

			<h3>Backend Features Performed by Node.js</h3>
		</div>
			
			<p>
			On my own, I was not aware how Electron uses Node.js.  However, 
			<a href="https://medium.com/@paulbjensen/how-does-node-js-work-with-nw-js-and-electron-da9e50e2c3c1"
			target="_blank">this website</a> elaborates on it. Quoting from the website:
			
			<br>
		
			<div class="w3-container w3-pale-blue w3-border w3-round-large">
			“Electron uses Node.js along with Chromium, but rather than combining the event loops of the two pieces of software together, it combines them through Node.js’ node bindings feature. In this way, the Chromium and Node.js components can be updated easily without the need for custom modification of the source code, nor compilation afterwards.”

			<h3>Database Features</h3>
		</div>
		
			<p>
			The database for The Spelling Game consists of 26 recordings of hard-to-spell words.  These were recorded by the game’s developer, Tom Nally.  Each of the 26 recordings is played by an mp3-playing function.  For example, the function which plays the hard-to-spell g-word ("guillotine") is this one:
			<br><br>
			function g_playAudio()
