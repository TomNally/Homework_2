		<h3>Starting out...</h3>
		</div>
		
		<div class="w3-container">
		<p>
		As part of our Homework 2 assignment, we were asked (among other things) to 
		customize our portfolio page by making a portion of it interactive using JavaScript. 
		Alternatively, we were given the option of developing a client-side JavaScript app. 
		I decided that I would write a game of some kind.
		</p>
		<p>
		I decided that a spelling game would be doable, and would require no animation.  But what 
		form would it take?  I considered a fill-in-the-blank spelling game, where a few letters 
		would be provided, and the player would have to fill in the remainder of the letters. 
		</p>
		<p>
		An example might look like this: c _ _ e. But there are <i>too many</i> solutions to this kind of a spelling game. 
		Below, you can see a few, but there are probably hundreds. 
		</p>
		
		<ul class="w3-ul w3-card w3-sand" style="width:30%">
		<li>cave</li>
		<li>cafe</li>
		<li>cove</li>
		<li>come</li>
		<li>cite</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
		Subsequently, it occurred to me that if I could record my voice speaking a 
		hard-to-spell word, then have the player attempt to spell it in a text box, 
		I could evaluate the spelling, and pronounce it <i>correct</i> or <i>not correct</i>. 
		That's what I did. 
		</p>

		<h3>Development</h3>
		</div>
		
		<div class="w3-container">
		<p>
		To record my voice, I used a built-in Windows 10 app called <i>Voice Recorder</i>. 
		Using a free <a href="https://www.freac.org/">tool</a>, I converted the native Voice Recorder 
		format, m4a, to mp3 format. Since there is little that <i>can't</i> be done with JavaScript, 
		I figured that there must be a way to play audio files. 
		I relied on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_audio_play.asp">this</a> 
		tutorial from w3schools. 
		</p>

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		</div>
		
		<div class="w3-container">
		<p>
		Ideally, a developer would want to place all scriping in a single js file, and source 
		that file from somewhere within the html file. I found, however, that the JavaScript 
		player would not work unless the <i>script</i> tag was internal to the html file. 
		</p>
		<p>
		If the player didn't have to worry about uppercase/lowercase, that would make the game 
		more enjoyable. But the console would report errors on JavaScript's toLowerCase() method. 
		My only choice was to prompt the user to <i>use lower case only</i>.
